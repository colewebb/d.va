    <h2 id="intro">Introduction and Warnings</h2>
    <p>
      This is a guide for anyone who is looking to make their Android phone more secure, including and specifically victims of domestic violence and stalking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that this guide is not foolproof. Due to the incredible complexity of today's smartphones, there is no technique that make your phone completely secure. The goal of this guide is to make it so difficult to hack or track your phone that it would take a large corporation or a small country to do it effectively. This guide should do that, but there may be something that I overlooked. I don't know.

        <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
        <h3>Apps to install</h3>
        <p>We recommend installing the following apps:
          <ul>
            <li>Orbot (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android</a>) and Orfox (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox</a>). These two apps together provide anonymous web browsing, something we'll come back to.</li>
            <li>Avast! Mobile Security (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.mobilesecurity">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.mobilesecurity</a>). This app does antivirus scans on your phone, and can detect dangerous apps on your phone (among other things, most of them useful).</li>
            <li>Fing (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing</a>). Fing monitors what devices are connnected to your Wifi.</li>
            <li>NoRoot Firewall (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall</a>). NoRoot Firewall is an Android firewall. I'll explain what that is <a href="./home.html#firewall-explanation">in a second</a>.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible for websites, and people, to track you online using a variety of tools. Orbot and Orfox are built on Tor, which was designed and built by the US Government to foil tracking tools. Orbot/Orfox also contains a set of privacy protection tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of those privacy and anti-tracking tools, the Internet will look a little different when you're using Orbot/Orfox. You'll get reCAPTCHAs more often (the things asking you to prove that you're not a robot). Your internet will be slower. Some sites might refuse you access. You'll have to sign into websites more often.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avast! Mobile Security has a couple of tools that we have found useful in times past. Whenever an app is installed or updated, Avast! will check the app for viruses and let you what it finds. It will also scan your device on a regular basis for viruses, your network for vulnerabilities (weak or no password, out-of-date security, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Fing is a weird app. Its job is to look at your Wifi network and tell you what is connected to it. This is good for finding things that are connected that you don't want connected, like hidden cameras, audio bugs, stuff like that. It is possible for devices to hide from this app, but it is tricky. I've only ever seem one device that could do it. (If you're curious, it was a base for a home security system.) Basically, just open the app every once in a while, refresh it, and make sure that there's no surprises in the resultant list.
        </p>
        <p id="firewall-explanation">
          A firewall is a piece of software that regulates internet access. Basically, if you have an app installed, and there's no good reason for it to connect to the Internet, then you can prevent it from accessing the internet. Period. End of discussion. This particular firewall will notify you every time something tries to connect, and ask if you're cool with it. It's pretty cool. Of course, if you say yes, then the firewall will remember that and not ask you again. You can always revoke this permission.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p id="apps-to-remove">
        <h3>Apps to remove</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend removing the following apps:
          <ul>
            <li>Facebook</li>
            <li>Facebook Messenger</li>
            <li>Snapchat</li>
            <li>Pokemon GO</li>
            <li>Twitter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are all apps that have the ability to publicly post your physical location. Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Twitter can all be accessed online (Messenger requires a little bit of work though; I'll go over that in a separate guide, linked <a href="./messenger-in-firefox.html">here</a>). They are not as pretty online, but they are functional, and using the online version makes it harder for the websites to grab your location.
